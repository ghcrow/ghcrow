- 👋 Hi, I’m @ghcrow
- 👨‍💼 I'm a Senior DevOps Engineer, working predominantly with GCP. I'm skilled in CI/CD (GitHub Actions and GitLab CI), Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, etc.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development (prior experience with Python (Django), HTML, CSS and a little JS). Looking to learn more JS (mainly focusing on React), maybe learn some node.js too as a next step.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic React skills, and hoping I can do some moe Python on my own side projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really!
